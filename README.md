# DogFam üê∂üè†

An iOS app made using Swift, SwiftUI & Firebase (Cloud Firestore).

## The problem

When I was looking to adopt a dog from a shelter, I ran into a main issue: I didn't know where to search.  
I already have 2 dogs so it was even harder to find a dog which will get on well with them.  
I started looking on several shelters' websites but they were barely up to date.  
Moreover, there was no way to filter the dogs (as I could only rescue a female which accepts other dogs & children).  
Same for Facebook groups (which are more up to date).  

## The solution

I created DogFam (previously DoggoHome) to make such searches easier.  
DogFam let everyone (as long as they're registered) add a dog which is available for adoption & specify his/her characteristics.  
You don't need to be a registered shelter to add a dog as - usually on Facebook groups - it's mainly kept up to date thanks to volunteers.  
The dog is then listed on the main screen's list.  
The user who is looking for a dog can filter the search according his/her/. needs.  

## Features
